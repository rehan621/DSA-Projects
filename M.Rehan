The **Library Book Search System** is a project designed to help users efficiently search for books in a library's collection by title or author.
It allows for storing book records using arrays or vectors and supports searching through linear or binary search methods. Users can input new books with details like 
title, author, and ID. The system provides options to view, add, or remove books from the catalog. Sorting can also be applied to enhance search performance through binary 
search.
